It is frustrating because they continue to play the victim despite the lies told by them and each conversation just goes in circles. I thought being honest was the best interest for the both of us but it seems to make things worse.I am frustrated that they do not see their wrong doings and due to me telling the truth they continue to bring up their hurt feelings and not acknowledging mine. I tried to block them and just stop speaking but was told to try and get more money from them which is what made things go horribly wrong but they did not even notice they were not even talking to me at all.
